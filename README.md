# JavaScript-Diagram-SamplesMindFusion.Diagramming for JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas


### ABOUT JSDIAGRAM

 JsDiagram is a JavaScript library that provides to web applications the ability to create and display various kinds of interactive diagrams. The component supports workflow, flowchart and process diagrams, object hierarchy and relationship charts, entity-relationship diagrams, structures like graphs and trees.
 Every behavioral and appearance aspect of JsDiagram can be customized as suits best your project. Diagram elements can have different styles, colors, fonts and pictures. The control's programming model comprises hundreds of methods, properties and events.
 The package relies on the MicrosoftAjax library for its JavaScript type system implementation and browser independence.

### SOURCE CODE

 A JsDiagram copy can be purchased with the control's full source code. JsDiagram is developed entirely in JavaScript using the HTML5 Canvas API.
